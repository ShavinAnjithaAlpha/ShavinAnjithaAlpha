Even if my carrier field is engineering, I learning many different science-related fields like physics, mathematics, philosophy, chemistry, etc.. in my free time to improve my knowledge base and to my satisfaction.

### In the case of computer-related fields, building some software, programs, websites are my favorite things to do. I always trying to do some new things using my computer-related knowledge which makes me feel satisfied and enjoyable. As I said, I know different computer languages and technologies. Python is my preferred computer language and Java and C++ are also my favorite computer languages. In the web development field, I know a few web-based languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and also MySQL. 

### Because python is my preferred language, most of my repositories are based on the python code base. In addition to that, Java projects and Web-based projects are also available in my repositories.
